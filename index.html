                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">Muvie</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Muvie reads your mood from the music you are currently listening to and suggest you new movies to watch accordingly.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/junction-logo.png" alt="">
                  <p>Muvie is a web platform born during the Junction 48h Hackathon held at Aalto in November 2017. It is a story about music, cinema and experience conceived by our Happy Bee team as an answer to the challenge raised by Elisa: "My perfect personal movie experience".</p>
                  <p>The idea or initial concept comes from our personal frustration as series or movie consumers that, sometimes, we cannot find anything to watch. We cannot put words on what we actually want to see but rather we <i>feel</i> inclined to watch one video or not. Yet, such feelings can hardly be explained and heavily rely on our own perception or previous knowledge levels of the video content. But, what if we are looking for something new?</p>
                  <p>Such annoying, desperate quests are well-known among the people we met, our friends and relatives. We all can spend ages deciding upon what movie to watch, thus ruining a significant part of our evening... Although, what does best translate our feelings, our emotional state than music? Muvie therefore became our tentative to match our mood from music to movies.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/muvie.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>To do so, we of course shared the building of our prototypes into several pieces. Omar and I designed and developed a smart algorithm extracting 8-dimensional vector representing the main emotional state translated by a song lyrics, tempo, loudness and danceability as well as by a movie summary and keywords. It also builds clusters of movies and eventually matches songs emotional vectors to a specific subset of movies to be suggested. In practice, our algorithm suggested horror and thriller movies to users listening to hard rock and rock songs while romantic comedy movies to pop songs addicts for instance. In addition, Shuang and I designed and built a simple, neat and user-friendly interface both enjoyable to look at and easy to understand. Indeed, we included a feedback on our final interpretation of the user current mood as well as embodied trailer playing all together in our platform.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/muvie-team.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>Muvie received numerous positive and enthusiastic feedbacks from all testers, be it Junctions judges or curious visitors. We ranked 3rd out of 20 projects in our track and won the Junction Challenge "My perfect personal movie experience by Elisa" thanks to our hard work, our team effort and our passion!</p>

Been so frustrated when you finally reach your dream windsurf spot and there is no wind? Or that you are unable to get a glimpse of the famous Northern lights because of those bloody clouds? Then SunnyExpress is for you!</p>

                  <p>From a crazy idea I suggested in our brainstorming session around daily life pain relievers, our 4-people group designed and built this web-based application you can play with to find the best place to be according to your weather likings. We turned our course final project, pretext to display out newly acquired skills in Dynamic Web programming (here MVC architecture and Javascript/AngularJS) into this playful user-centred service experience.</p>
                  <p>For this ambitious project, we integrated end-users’ feedbacks for the whole process: from the ideation phase through paper prototypes to a video presentation via increasingly detailed online prototypes to best mock final interactions.</p>
                  <p>Basically, from these basic prototypes:</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>We built Sunny Express you can experience through the following Screencast:</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>My major role in this project was to lead and manage the ideation process and design phase. As a result, I was later on responsible for the overall responsive layout and consistent look of the client side of our web App, HTML/CSS speaking. During the development phase, I also built the Home and Calendar views while contributing from time to time to my team mates tasks as we of course collaborate on mine. My personal biggest achievement was to actually implement a dynamic web application, which I have never done before. I learned a lot from my team mates and the programming concrete practice. I loved the challenge and eventually impressed myself!</p>

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/instore.png" alt="">
                  <p>
                    As part of one of our design class, we created a 4 designers to be team to enhance the retail worker experience. To do so, our design team first individually observed
                    and interviewed several sellers in different stores located in Stockholm city centers such and H&M, Lindex, Indiska and Dressman.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Afterwards, we gathered all our observations and categorizes them in order to identify the main pain points retail workers were experiencing in their daily work life.
                  </p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/store-observations.png" alt="">
                  <p>
                    We eventually unearthed together major pain points which mainly revolved arount logistic and time management.
                  </p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/pain-points.png" alt="">
                  <p>
                    In order to adress these issues, we breainstormed ideas and created low fidelity prototypes.

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/paper-prototype.png" alt="">
                  <p>
                    Once we produced a satisfying solution, we created a higher fidelity version of our selected prototypes. We then returned to the stores and tested our products
                    with sales clerk. We refined device based on their feebacks. We iterated this procedure three times.

                    It was an extremaly enriching experience to walk in a UX designer shoes and be thrown in the field. Our team faced several challenges that mad us grow. In particular,
                    reaching out to sales clerks to get interviews and to test our high fidelity prototype was more challenging than we first expected and therefore certain compromises had to be made.
                    We, for instance, could not test our prototypes in real life use situations. We also had to have a set of predefined tasks so that the reviews were as time efficient as possible for the testers.

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/health.png" alt="">
                  <p>During my first summer internship in the private hospital Clinique Pasteur of Toulouse in 2015, I have noticed that most of the patients that the doctors I was working for dealt with were old people coming for the whole day for regular check-up. They were dragged all day long from one part of the building to another in order to submit themselves to medical examinations that could have been done in their home, provided that the technology existed.</p>
                  <p>Actually, it exists. Wireless sensors measuring data such as blood pressure and heart rate are produced and available to use. Unfortunately, they are sold separately and at a relatively high price for personal use.</p>
                  <p>That is why I thought about a universal platform that would gather all the relevant medical data measured by a set of chosen sensors and send it back to doctors for diagnoses and potential interventions and developed a startup around this idea with my Entrepreneurship class group.</p>
                  <p>The aim of this 2-months project was to come up with a sustainable business model and pitch it to Venture Capitalists in order to raise money. Through methodical research, benchmarking brainstorming and discussion, we eventually build an innovative business model mainly based on the following concepts:</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/domuscurae.png" alt="">
                  <p>The direct client would be the insurance companies. They would buy the product and service and then hand it back to doctors and patients in return of a little increase in their health insurance.</p>
                  <p>Owing to this service, the patients would be able to stay home, save money, live longer and happier. Indeed, their health would be guaranteed - diseases prevention and recovery watch - and doctors would be able to provide more accurate care and cure for more people. Besides, insurance companies would save huge amount of money spent each year for highly expensive surgeries and treatments that could be prevented by using such device.</p>
                  <p>The final pitch was a success: the two VC saw a real worthy opportunity there. One even offered us to help build the product if we were willing to pursue the project further. The major strength of Domus Curae was that, not only have we spotted an existing right problem, but we created this project as team, around our specific combined set of skills and networks as well as the pilot hospital candidate. Consequently, it was a fascinating and considerably rewarding experience.</p>

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">An interesting attempt to generate classical music using Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural networks</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/groovybee.png" alt="">
                  <p>
                    As part of our common Deep learning class team project, a friend and I found exciting to try and generate music using neural network. Indeed, musical activities heavily
                    rely on human memory mechanisms that Artificial Neural Networks were conceived to and are now relatively able to mimic. As such, we decided to explore the possibility of
                    using raw audio samples, digitized as Midi files, to train a Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural network (LSTM).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    LSTMs are the popular choice for handling timeseries datasets. They are de facto well suited for audio files. Previous work in the field includes variety of
                    music data, including musical notes represented as both sequence of characters and numerical vectors. Although, they seldom address the polymorphic aspect of
                    classical music. Therefore, we adopted various methodologies to process the raw audio dataset into suitable format for the LSTM network training, and implementation
                    of a custom architecture for the end-to-end LSTM network using the library PyTorch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a dataset, we extracted instrument level data from a MIDI track. The data was sanitized, the silence periods removed. The end goal was to ultimately discover the
                    effectiveness of learning an univariate distribution. We trained a first two-layer network then a second improved version. Eventually, the generated succession of notes
                    are compared with the pattern of musical notes in existing Midi files, to understand the effectiveness of the output of the network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The modified LSTM implementation led to improvement in predictions. However, when the output was transformed back into MIDI files, the audio was more coherent in terms
                    of stability but did not exhibit structural integrity expected from a musical composition. Without incorporating silence periods, the output sounds becomes disorganized.
                    Moreover, MIDI files contain events like SetTempo, which dictate the value of BPM of beats per minute, for a particular musical note (pitch), at a time interval. These events
                    were not included in the data set where all instruments were separated, and therefore reduce the likelihood of retaining structural integrity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our experiemnt clearly showed that using digitized audio samples did not offer much improvements over transcribed audio data containing musical characters. Nevertheless in theory,
                    cascading of neural networks that individually learn and track changes in tempo, notes from various instruments, and silence periods would lead to better results in terms of
                    musical integrity and composition.

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">
                    I was hired by Pond - PWC Expirience Center, to help their data scientist understand marketers behaviours and job to identify where Econometric modelling would be relevant for them to use on a daily basis.
                  </p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/ml-marketing.png" alt="">
                  <p>
                    Owing to the Machine Learning spread, in particular the Econometric modelling progress, marketers are now able to daily monitor and control
                    the marketing effect of their campaigns, thus optimising their advertising investments. Although several decision support tools and Data analysts
                    consultants currently provide marketers with these data-driven insights, only few manage to understand the algorithms outcomes and act upon the extracted
                    insights on their own. Therefore, my master thesis focused on answerig this critical question: How to design a user- friendly ML-based decision support
                    system (DSS) delivering understandable insights that marketers act upon?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The then current delivery of data-driven insights to marketers at Pond - PWC Expirience Center was either too complex or too simple. As a result, most marketers failed
                    to identify useful and relevant information from the analysis of their own customers data without the support of their data analyst consultants. Besides, the models were
                    based on three-year-old data and only updated once to three times per year. Thus, marketers considered their outcomes seldom representative of the current market state in
                    the long run. As a matter of fact, this user research I conducted centered around an exisiting algorithm showed that marketers would rather have a computer based test
                    environment relying on regular model updates than occasional PowerPoint presentations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The user research consisted a content analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted as rigorous Contextual Design Inquiries with 11 marketers
                    familiar with Econometric modelling. When authorized, I recorded then transcibed every interviews. The transcripts and personal notes taken live from the interviews were then
                    rigorously analysed according to two methodologies: a manifest content analysis to unnderstand their work dynamics and a latent content analysis to shed light on why
                    they need data insights. The extracted patterns were then validated through a second round of interviews and eventually produced four representative set of marketers
                    work-models and personas.
                  </p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-inline-block" src="img/portfolio/personas.png" alt="" style="width:46%;margin-right:6%">
                  <img class="img-fluid d-inline-block" src="img/portfolio/workmodels.png" alt="" style="width:46%;">
                  <p>
                    The latent analysis all showed that all interviewees were already convinced and trusting the insights provided by Econometrics modelling.
                    They even considered them business relevant and essential in their daily job. This hinted that only a small step was required to bring customised Machine-learning outcomes
                    and data-driven insights to the reach of not only marketers but any non data scientist specialist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thus, these 11 deep interviews all contributed to identify the three main tasks the digital tool must accomplish to help marketers. First, it should display a centralised overview
                    of what is currently happening in the market and how their marketing strategies are doing. Second, the tool should contribute to optimise their marketing budget in the aim
                    to reach the marketers company business goals. Third, it has to enhance the communication between the marketers, their media agency and their top-management team. By realising
                    these three jobs through a portable, pertinent and task compliant user-centered tool, the data-driven tool would then constitute a major business asset for the marketers company.
                    Not only would it dramatically increase the efficiency and profitability of marketing activities along with the business managers trust in marketing benefits, but it would also
                    empower marketers to accurately control their budget marketing effect and negotiate their costs down with media channel publishers for instance.
